=======================================
During lab, we setup our hard drives and began doing some work on the lab.  I was able to finish the white box by simply adjusting the code given to us in the lab handout by rotating the cub and setting it's position.

=======================================
I was able to finish the Cornell Box scene realatively quickly, except I had some trouble with the light.  I also started to work on the method makeStarirs for the staircase in App.cpp.

=======================================
I was finally able to figure out the light in the Cornell Box scene.  It is still too bright, but I decided to contiue work on the staircase, almost done with the makeStairs method.

=======================================
Went to Jamies office hours where she gave some very helpful advice on some tips to use in Visual Studio.  Still need to finish debugging my makeStairs method.  Also wrote a create Scene method to commit the string returned by the makeStairs method and save it to a file.

=======================================
Finally finished the staircase.  It took a while to figure out how to make it actually look like a staircase.  The solution I found was to use a transformGeometry so that the center of all the stairs are located at the same place.  Started working on my custom scene.  Going for a snack bar break now.

=======================================
Finished my custom scene.  IO wrote it by hand which, looking back, was a mistake, but it's done now.  Going to sleep.

Finished report and took pictures of results done with the first lab!
